Most of the time it's frustating that we need to download a releases from [Samsung OSRC](https://opensource.samsung.com), especially Kernel sources. And if we have a server that we build the source on, we need to upload it into there first. What a time-wasting, right?

Well, this script solves it! With this script, you can download the release directly from your Terminal! No need to download-reupload anymore. Just run, choose the release, and download ðŸ˜Ž

# Installation

First, we need to install Python 3, PIP, and Git in order to run the script.

For example, for Debian-based Linux distribution:

```
# apt install python3 python3-pip git -y
```

Then, clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hendramanudinata03/osrc_download.git
Cloning into 'osrc_download'...
...
$ cd osrc_download/
```

Before running the script for the first time, please install required dependencies:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the script:

```
$ python3 osrc_download.py
```

It will ask you to choose device model and the specific source you want to download. Soon after that, the download will start. Enjoy some snacks or a coffee, because it will take some time.

# TODOs

- [ ] Allow uninteractive usage, useful for automation processes (e.g. CI)
- [ ] Require user to choose download directory and/or target file name
